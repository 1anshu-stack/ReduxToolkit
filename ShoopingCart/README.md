# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




API:- https://fakestoreapi.com/products.

Dependencies:- react-bootstrap, bootstrap,

we created our store, redux and components but to make them communicating with each other "idealy we have provide our state that be have created to our component pages" to do this react binding comes in the picture.

Provider is a way to provide our redux state to our components.
